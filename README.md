Hangman - Jacob Daniels

hangman.py is a computer game designed to be run in any python interpreter.
Whether it be online or in your terminal, the game runs the same.
There is an array of different words the game will select from and the player
guesses each letter, one by one. If the player guesses wrong too many times,
the man is hung and the player loses.

When the player loses, the game tells the user what the word was and asks if
they would like to play again. If so, the variables are re-initialized and
a new word is selected.

When the player wins, the game congratulates the player and asks if they
would like to play again.

When the player chooses not to play again, the game prints a goodbye message
and terminates. If you are on a web-based python interpreter, you have a
better chance at seeing this message, as terminal instances usually close
once their script is terminated.
